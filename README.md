# Nic Amerongen's Favourite Things

Student repository for an application showcasing personal interests using a database to call upon relevant grouped content.

This program will send requests to the database to diplay a gallery of information describing three pieces of media accompanied by a poster, title and description. 

The commits for this project are only recently pushed to the repo as I focused on getting the classfile to work correctly and then in the process of rewriting it out referencing the working class file I broke the program. I should have seeked out assistance earlier but I had a false sense of confidence based on the success of the class file. 

I have been unable to put the dedication I would have liked to due to some startling unexpected circumstances outside of school that I have no control over, however moving forward I have managed to gain the opportunity to be hopefully available for the AMA's and I plan to make use of my time to fully understand where in my application I did not produce correctly. Then I can have ensured success on future projects.

currently the error I have been unsuccessful with getting over is

TypeError: Cannot read property 'appendChild' of null
